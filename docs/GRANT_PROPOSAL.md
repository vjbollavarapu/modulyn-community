        bytes32 completionHash,
        string memory photoHash
    ) external {
        ServiceRecord storage service = services[serviceId];
        require(service.serviceProvider == msg.sender, "Unauthorized");
        
        service.completed = true;
        service.completionHash = completionHash;
        service.completedAt = block.timestamp;
